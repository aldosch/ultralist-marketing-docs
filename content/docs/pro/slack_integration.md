Ultralist's aim is to integrate with the tools you already work with.  With our Slack integration you can:

* View and manage your list within Slack
* Get a 9am daily agenda sent to you in Slack
* Create tasks based upon slack messages

## Installing the Slack integration

In order to install the integration, you must be a Slack administrator. Install the integration via this button below:

<a href="https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=1140265225543.1176926993365&scope=commands&user_scope="><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcSet="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x" /></a>

Once completed, you'll be redirected back to Ultralist, with a notification saying the Ultralist Slack app has been installed.

## Associating Ultralist with Slack

Ultralist needs to know which Slack user is yours.  So the initial command you need to run in Slack is `/ul login`.  You'll get a screen like this:

Click the **Connect account** button.  You'll be redirected to Ultralist.  From there, choose the primary list you'd like to use when interacting inside Slack.
