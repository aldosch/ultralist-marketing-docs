Ultralist's aim is to integrate with the tools you already work with.  With our Slack integration you can:

* View and manage your list within Slack
* Get a 9am daily agenda sent to you in Slack
* Create tasks based upon slack messages

## Installing the Slack integration

In order to install the integration, you must be a Slack administrator. Install the integration via this button below:

{{< slack-button >}}

Once completed, you'll be redirected back to Ultralist, with a notification saying the Ultralist Slack app has been installed.

## Associating Ultralist with Slack

Ultralist needs to know which Slack user is yours.  So the initial command you need to run in Slack is `/ul login`.  You'll get a screen like this:

Click the **Connect account** button.  You'll be redirected to Ultralist.  From there, choose the primary list you'd like to use when interacting inside Slack.

Once finished, you're good to use the slack integration!
